NORML Canada declares that the criminal prohibition of the cultivation 
and use of cannabis is no longer the most suitable measure for protecting 
public health and welfare and preventing the diversion of drugs into 
illicit traffic. The legalization, regulation, and taxation of the 
substance represents the most suitable measure to accomplish those 
objectives. The organization aims to eliminate all civil and criminal 
penalties for private marijuana use – through government lobbying, 
public education, research, and legislative and judicial challenges.
