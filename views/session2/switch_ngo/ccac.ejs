The Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) is a not for profit organization 
responsible for setting, maintaining, and overseeing the implementation of high 
standards for animal ethics and care in science throughout Canada. The CCAC works 
to ensure that animal-based science in Canada takes place only when necessary and 
that the animals in the studies receive optimal care according to high quality, 
research-informed standards.

CCAC oversees research using animal testing that has improved health, prevented 
disease and saved lives of both humans and animals. Life-changing therapies 
ranging from vaccines and cancer therapies to organ transplants have helped 
millions worldwide.
